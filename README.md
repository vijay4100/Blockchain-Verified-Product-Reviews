## 📘 Project Title  
### **Blockchain-Verified Product Reviews**

---

## 📖 Overview  
**Blockchain-Verified Product Reviews** is a Web3 platform built on **CoreDAO** that ensures trust in product reviews by allowing only on-chain verified buyers to leave feedback. This decentralized mechanism drastically reduces fake reviews, spam, and manipulation by leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic verification.

---

## 🎯 Vision  
To establish a **transparent**, **community-governed**, and **tamper-proof** review system where only genuine users can contribute feedback. We aim to rebuild trust in online product ratings and support ethical commerce through decentralized incentives and verifiable trust mechanisms.
